Deborah was a Catholic girl
She held out to the bitter end
Carla was a different type
She's the one who put it in
Mary was a black girl
And I was afraid of a girl like that
Susan painted pictures
Sitting down like the Buddha sat

Reno was a nameless girl
A geographic memory
Cathy was a Jesus freak
She liked that kind of misery
Vicki had this special way
Of turning sex into a song
Kamala who couldn't sing
Kept the beat and kept it strong

Zilla was an archetype,
The voodoo queen the queen of wrath
Joan thought men were second best
To masturbating in the bath
Sherri was a feminist
She really had that gift of gab
Kathleen's point of view was this
Take whatever you can grab

Seattle was another girl
Who left her mark upon the map
Karen liked to tie me up
And left me hanging by a strap
Jeannie had this nightclub walk
That made grown men feel underage
Mariella who had a son
Said I must go but finally stayed

Gloria the last taboo
Was shattered by her tongue one night
Mimi brought the taboo back
And held it up before the light
Marilyn who knew no shame
Was never ever satisfied
Julie came and went so fast
She didn't even say good-by

Well Rhonda had a house in Venice
Lived on brown rice and cocaine
Patty had a house in Houston
Shot cough syrup in her veins
Linda thought her life was empty
Filled it up with alcohol
Katherine was much too pretty
She didn't do that shit at all

Uh-uh. Not Katherine.

Pauline thought that love was simple
Turn it on and turn it off
Jean-Marie was complicated
Like some French film-maker's plot
Gina was the perfect lady
Always kept her stockings straight
Jackie was a rich punk-rocker
Silver spoon and a paper plate

Sarah was a modern dancer
Lean pristine transparency
Janet wrote bad poetry
In a crazy kind of urgency
Tanya Turkish liked to fuck
While wearing leather biker boots
Brenda's strange obsession
Was for certain vegetables and fruit

Rowena was an artist's daughter
The deeper image shook her up
Dee Dee's mother left her father
Took his money and his truck
Debbie Rae had no such problems
Perfect Norman Rockwell home
Nina, 16, had a baby
Left her parents, lived alone
Bobbi joined a New Wave band
Changed her name to Bobbi Sox
Eloise, who played guitar,
Sang songs about whales and cops
Terri didn't give a shit
Was just a nihilist
Ronnie was much more my style
Cause she wrote songs just like this
Jezebel went forty days
Drinking nothing but Perrier
Dinah drove her Chevrolet
Into the San Francisco Bay
Judy came from Ohio
She's a Scientologist
Amaranta, here's a kiss
I chose you to end this list

Eighty-eight lines about forty-four women.
