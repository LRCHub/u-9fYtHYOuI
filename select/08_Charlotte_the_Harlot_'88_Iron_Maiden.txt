Giving a swish with your arse in the air,
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined,
When you take all the love that they're giving.

Sticking with every man that you find,
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air,
Don't you hear all their laughter?

Charlotte the harlot
Show me your leg.
Charlotte the harlot
Take me to bed.
Charlotte the harlot
Let me see blood.
Charlotte the harlot
Let me see love.

Taking so many men to you room,
Don't you feel no remorse.
You charge them a fiver only for starters,
And ten the main course.
You've got no feelings,
They died long ago.
Don't you care who you let in,
Don't you know you're breaking the law,
With the service you're giving.

Charlotte the harlot
Show me your leg.
Charlotte the harlot
Take me to bed.
Charlotte the harlot
Let me see blood.
Charlotte the harlot
Let me see love.

There was a time when you left me standing there,
Picking up pieces of love from the floor,
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there,
To make your ends as a bloody whore.

Well Charlotte you told me you loved me true.
Picking up pieces of love yesterday.
Well Charlotte your drawers are off colour too,
'Cause you're making love all day.

Giving a swish with your arse in the air,
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined,
When you take all the love that they're giving.

Sticking with every man that you find,
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air,
Don't you hear all their laughter?

Charlotte the harlot
Show me your leg.
Charlotte the harlot
Take me to bed.
Charlotte the harlot
Let me see blood.
Charlotte the harlot
Let me see love.
