Gravity and entropy
They have it out inside of me

Eighty-eight ways to build and destroy
I dig my own grave. I carve my decoy.
O. What should I be in this world so self-destructing
O, what should I be in this world so self-constructing

Eighty-eight ways to build and destroy
I fuel my decay. I trample my joy
O, what should I be in this world so self-destructing
O, what should I be in this world so self-constructing

Gravity and entropy
They have it out inside of me

The hermit and the hero walk in parallel lines
One with bow and arrow, the other bowed eyes
In the house of mirrors
Looking different but the same
One pendulum swings from loving
To and back from disdain

Eighty-eight ways to build and destroy
I dig my own grave. I carve my decoy
O, what should I be in this world so self-destructing
O, What should I be in this world so self-constructing

Gravity and entropy
They have it out inside of me
