"I am tired and I'm bored,", he said. /
"And I've got kinks in my bed. /
This work, how I hate it, I'd much rather play, /
Nothing to do, but I do need a rest." /

[Whispered:] let's just get started and make a mess...

Morton stood up and said "what's that? /
It's the fifteenth of may, and I'm cold, and I'm wet." /
He turned without stopping / and smiled to the pilot.
People weather the terrible storm. /

A distant space???

[Stephen:]
A scene from a film circa 1982.
We drove down george street, en route to wendy's.
Glenn campbell was on the radio singing about cleaning his gun
And dreaming of galveston.
"What's this? " she said.
"It's hall & oates or nothing for me."

Of course, this was pre-house nation

And I asked her "what is anyone going to remember this decade for? "
She paused for a second, then said:
"Waffle cardigans, wentworth jail,
Rah-rah skirts straight out of hell,
Andrew??? and bmx bikes,
Chernenko and miners' strikes,
Nikky kershaw and red ken,
Peter tatchell and dirty den,
Mark king slapped his bass,
And early issues of the face,
Sigue sigue sputnik, margaret thatcher,
Toto coelo, and spycatcher,
E.t., arthur, elmo's fire,
Not a patch on billy liar,
Phil redmond and transformers,
Tin-tin duffy in leg-warmers,
Stu damer, evil tel,
Roger hebert, what a pal,
Steven waldorf, jerry gross,
Do the hucklebuck by coast to coast,
Steve blacknell on the telly,
The classic beard of altobelli,
Leon klinghofer, baby duck(?),
Blonde highlights, flourescent sock,
Steve lynex and gordon smith,
Martin fry grew a quiff,
Haysi fantayzee, videotech,
Shakey drove us crazy, what the heck,
Hazel o'connor in breaking glass,
Gripper stebson's in the class."

And I said, "i don't remember any of that. if you can remember the '80s you weren't there. uh, you know, I remember scott crolla in his furry freak brothers t-shirt, if that's anything."
